Once upon a time, there were three computer science students named Alex, Bella, and Chris. 
They were all in their final year of college and had a major project to complete before graduation. 
The project was worth a significant portion of their grade and they had been working on it for weeks. 
However, they were struggling to complete it on time and were worried about their grades.

One day, Alex suggested that they use ChatGPT, an AI language model, to complete their project. 
At first, Bella and Chris were hesitant but they eventually agreed to use the tool to help them. They 
fed in their project requirements and the AI provided them with the code that they needed. 
They quickly finished the project and submitted it to their professor.

However, the professor quickly noticed that the code was plagiarized and suspected that the students 
had cheated. She called them in for a meeting and confronted them with the evidence. The students 
tried to defend themselves, but the professor was not convinced.

In the end, the professor gave the students a failing grade and warned them about the consequences of 
cheating. She explained that cheating is not only unethical but also undermines the purpose of education. 
She reminded them that the real value of learning is in the process of acquiring knowledge and skills, 
not just in the final grade.

The students learned their lesson the hard way and regretted their decision to cheat. They realized that 
cheating might seem like a shortcut to success, but it ultimately leads to failure and loss of integrity. 
They vowed to never cheat again and to take responsibility for their own learning.

The moral of the story is that cheating may seem like an easy way out, but it is ultimately 
self-destructive. Learning and growing through honest effort is the key to true success and personal fulfillment. 

This story was generated by ChatGPT! Even an AI knows honesty is the best policy;)! -Love Mrs. Klaka
